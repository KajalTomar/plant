# everything in the while loop keeps happening over and over again
# as long as the while condition is true

# indentations in the right place are important. You always indent once for all the lines that are inside a function. 

# what will this condition do? 
# while (not(0==1))

# ask them to come up with their own statement that is always true
# so that we can run the loop forever (ex: while True, while 5==5, while 4!=6, while not false)
while (1==1):
    display.scroll("Hello, world.")
